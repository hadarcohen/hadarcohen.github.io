      <h2>the story</h2>

      <p>we are on a mission to disrupt the current cultural narrative in tech.</p>
      <p>we love the tech community. the lean approach that is user-driven and constantly learning. agents of disruption. We know our world needs disruption to innovate and grow. </p>

      <p>we have a problem. Gender discrimination is prevalent in our collective culture, and particularly in the tech industry. We are committed to working for gender equality in the tech workplace. </p>

      <p>women make up 59% of the US labor force and almost 51% of the entire US population but are underrepresented in the tech world. </p>
      <br><img src="img/pie.png" alt="data" class="pie"><br>
      <p>the data reveals there is a problem in gender equality. there are many reasons why this data is such:</p>
      <li>education pipeline</li>
      <li>recruitment and hiring practices</li>
      <li>women are not interested in tech</li>
      <li>women are entering the tech world but progress is slow</li>
      <img src="img/rumi.png" alt="rumi" class="rumi">

      <p>these are all true. yet the undercurrent that is the foundation of this problem is gender discrimination. Our work is to surface a conversation that has been deeply invisibilized to shift culture to one of inclusion and acceptance.</p>
